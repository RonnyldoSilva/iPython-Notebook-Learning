# iPython Notebook Learning

This tutorial is from: http://cs231n.github.io/ipython-tutorial/

### Prerequisite: Python

While Jupyter runs code in many programming languages, Python is a requirement (Python 3.3 or greater, or Python 2.7) for installing the Jupyter Notebook itself.

### Installing Jupyter using Anaconda

Install Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/

### Installing Jupyter with pip

As an existing or experienced Python user, you may wish to install Jupyter using Pythonâ€™s package manager, pip, instead of Anaconda.

If you have Python 3 installed (which is recommended):

```
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip
python3 -m pip install jupyter
```

If you have Python 2 installed:

```
python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install jupyter
```

Congratulations, you have installed Jupyter Notebook! To run the notebook, run the following command at the Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows):

```
jupyter notebook
```
